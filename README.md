MyJobs-pixel
============

A simple tracking pixel server that ensures that each request is tagged with an anonymous globally unique identifier (AGUID). It is very lightweight, requiring no database and very little disk space.

Logging the requests is intended to be the responsibility of the web server software that serves this.
